## Wine Quality Distribution
The following code will evaluate the basic descriptive statistics of the Wine Quality variable of interest/ variable to be tested in the machine learning algorithms.

```{r}
#import and view dataset
library(readxl)
winequalityred <- read_excel("C:/Users/sarah/Desktop/info8000/winequalityred.xlsx", 
    col_types = c("numeric", "numeric", "numeric", 
        "numeric", "numeric", "numeric", 
        "numeric", "numeric", "numeric", 
        "numeric", "numeric", "numeric"))
QualityMax<-max(winequalityred$quality)
QualityMin<-min(winequalityred$quality)
QualityAverage<-mean(winequalityred$quality)
QualityMedian<-median(winequalityred$quality)
QualityMax
QualityMin
QualityAverage
QualityMedian
QualityMode <- names(which.max(table(winequalityred$quality)))
